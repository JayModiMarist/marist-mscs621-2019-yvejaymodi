## Welcome to Yve Jay Modi's App


### Introduction

I create this clothes selection web app for my colleagues and I.
Every night we have to coordinate clothing for the next day. My colleague Benjamin
has to go and pull out the clothes, set them nicely and send a message in the group.
With this app, Benjamin will be able to just go on his phone and send us tomorrow's outfit 
with a click of a button (or two).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/JayModiMarist/marist-mscs621-2019-yvejaymodi/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
