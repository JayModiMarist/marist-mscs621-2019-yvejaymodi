## Welcome to Yve Jay Modi's App

https://mscs621finalproject.appspot.com/

### Introduction

I create this clothes selection web app for my colleagues and I.
Every night we have to coordinate clothing for the next day. My colleague Benjamin
has to go and pull out the clothes, set them nicely and send a message in the group.
With this app, Benjamin will be able to just go on his phone and send us tomorrow's outfit 
with a click of a button (or two).
This app also uses the Embeded Map Google API to show the location of our practice facility.
The map view also allows users to click on it to open Google Maps, and recieve directions to the facility.


### Architecture
```markdown

The app uses a Docker container (Posted on Docker Hub - https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jaymodimarist/mscs621finalproject/), which is deployed through Google App Engine.
In addition, the app uses Google Embeded Map API in order to present the Map that is visible on the page.
